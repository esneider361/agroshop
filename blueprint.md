# Blueprint: La Granja Directo

## Overview

This project is a modern, single-page web application for an agricultural products store called "La Granja Directo". The application will showcase various farm products, categorized for easy browsing, and provide a way for customers to get in touch.

## Design & Features

- **Homepage:** A welcoming interface with a prominent hero section and a clear value proposition.
- **Product Showcase:** A grid-based layout to display products within categories like "Fruits", "Vegetables", "Dairy", and "Cereals".
- **Modern UI/UX:**
    - Clean and visually appealing design.
    - Responsive layout for optimal viewing on all devices.
    - Interactive UI elements with subtle animations.
    - Use of web components for a modular and maintainable structure.
- **Contact Section:** A simple and accessible contact form.
- **Footer:** Containing contact information, social media links, and quick navigation.

## Current Plan

1. **Setup Initial HTML Structure:** Create the main `index.html` file with placeholders for the header, product sections, contact form, and footer.
2. **Develop CSS:** Create a `style.css` file to implement the design, focusing on a mobile-first approach.
3. **Implement Web Components:** Create a `main.js` file to define and register custom elements for reusable components like product cards.
